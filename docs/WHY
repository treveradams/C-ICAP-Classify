WHY?
====

This is one of the most essential questions in any human being's existence. I
cannot and will not pretend to answer why other than a few specific questions.


Why make an Internet content classifier?
========================================

This is a very difficult question and yet very easy.

1) My faith teaches that pornography is harmful and should not be viewed.
2) I have seen the effects of sexual addiction and pornography addiction on
many lives. I have seen the marriages it has destroyed, lives it has destroyed,
careers it has destroyed etc!
3) I know of instances where a good business nearly went bankrupt because of
sexual harassment lawsuits and other legal problems brought about by people
doing lingerie (intimate clothing and swimsuit) shopping at work, viewing of
pinups, viewing of pornography, etc.
4) I have seen lives ruined by addiction to online gaming.
5) I have seen lives ruined by addiction to gambling.

This list can have several more options.

Pornography/pinups, gambling and online gaming are especially insidious as they
also pose other risks:

1) These sites are designed to hook you, and if possible, addict you.
2) These sites, spyware pushing or not, often contain functionality to help
discover what will hook people fastest and most completely.
3) These sites often do push spy-ware, ad-ware, viruses, and other malware.
4) Studies have been done on porn, especially in relation to minors, and it can
be quite harmful.


Why didn't I make this?
=======================

I am not trying to outlaw speech or control anyone. This is designed for places
where people have reasonable control, agreements are in place, or there might
be legal requirements for filtering.

If you want to control people or destroy liberty/freedom, please go find
another program.


Why should you use this?
========================

Well, I believe the above paragraphs make this somewhat obvious.

1) You are a business or another type of entity which must protect yourself
from law suits by preventing addictive/addicted behavior or by preventing
viewing of scantily clad/provocatively posed women and men.
2) You are a business, service provider, kiosk owner, library, school, etc.
which, in the public interest, is blocking access to obscene, salacious or
damaging material.
3) You are a private family, church or other organization by agreement or
appropriate fiat (parents with minor children, etc.) decisions have been made
to block certain material.
