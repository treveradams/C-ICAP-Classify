.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfhs_learn\fP is a command-line, stand alone trainer used to train fhs
classifiers. fhs stands for Fast Hyperspace.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.BR PRIMARY_HASH_SEED
.br
.BR SECONDARY_HASH_SEED
.PP
   The hash seeds are used to prime the hashing algorithm. If
   these do not match in both the trainer, when training the
   data, and the classifier when classifying, the results are
   undefined. For this reason, this can be used as a sort of
   pseudo copy protection.
.PP
   Additionally, these values determine, to an extent, the
   number of collisions in hash data. The only way to know if
   you have chosen a good value is testing.
.PP
   Each seed is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 bit number.
   If is \fBnot\fR prefixed with "0x". All alpha characters
   should be uppercase.
.PP
   These \fBmust\fR be the same for all categories.
.PP
.BR INPUT_FILE_TO_LEARN
.PP
   This is the file to learn, of course. It must be a UTF-8
   text file, HTML file, or XML file.
.PP
.BR OUTPUT_FHS_FILES_FILE
.PP
   This is the file name for the category. Generally it should
   be CATEGORY_NAME.fhs. It should be stored in a directory
   where only other fhs files are stored.
.PP
WARNING: Spaces and case matter.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
You must always have all the files within each category share the hash seeds.
Additionally, all categories within the same classifier data set \fBmust\fR
share the same hash seeds.
