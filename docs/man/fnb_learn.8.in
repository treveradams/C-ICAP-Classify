.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfnb_learn\fP is a command-line, stand alone trainer used to train fnb
classifiers. fnb stands for Fast Naive Bayes.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.BR PRIMARY_HASH_SEED
.br
.BR SECONDARY_HASH_SEED
.PP
   The hash seeds are used to prime the hashing algorithm. If
   these do not match in both the trainer, when training the
   data, and the classifier when classifying, the results are
   undefined. For this reason, this can be used as a sort of
   pseudo copy protection.
.PP
   Additionally, these values determine, to an extent, the
   number of collisions in hash data. The only way to know if
   you have chosen a good value is testing.
.PP
   Each seed is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 bit number.
   If is \fBnot\fR prefixed with "0x". All alpha characters
   should be uppercase.
.PP
   These \fBmust\fR be the same for all categories.
.PP
.BR INPUT_FILE_TO_LEARN
.PP
   This is the file to learn, of course. It must be a UTF-8
   text file, HTML file, or XML file.
.PP
.BR INPUT_DIRECTORY_TO_LEARN
.PP
   Alternatively you can specify a directory to learn.
   All files must follow the same rules for individual file
   learning.
.PP
.BR OUTPUT_FNB_FILES_FILE
.PP
   This is the file name for the category. Generally it should
   be CATEGORY_NAME.fnb. It should be stored in a directory
   where only other fnb files are stored. It used to be that you
   should remove this file before calling with -d. This file is now
   used as a preload when -d option is used, so do not remove it,
   except if desiring to start from scratch.
.PP
.BR ZERO
.PP
   \fBZERO\fR specifies the zero point, an integer. This is the
   number of times that a hash feature must appear in the data
   before it can be stored. This option should only be used alone
   after all input data has been trained, as part of the training
   command for the last file to be learned, or with -d. All other
   uses will give undesirable results!
.PP
.BR NUMBER_OF_THREADS_TO_USE
   This is the number of threads to use when doing training.
   It will only have any useful effect when doing the training
   of a directory; not an individual file. This should not
   exceed the number of cores available.
.PP
WARNING: Spaces and case matter.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
You must always have all the files within each category share the hash seeds.
Additionally, all categories within the same classifier data set \fBmust\fR
share the same hash seeds.
.PP
.I -d\fR and \fI-i\fR are mutually exclusive. You can learn a single file or
you can learn a directory. You cannot do both.
.PP
.I -o\fR and \fI-z\fR can be used alone to simply execute zero point setting. In all other cases, -z is optional!

There of course aren't any bugs, but if you find any, you should first
consult https://github.com/treveradams/C-ICAP-Classify and, if
necessary, file a bug report there.
