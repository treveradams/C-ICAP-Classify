.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfhs_makepreload\fP is a command-line tool to make a preload hash for for fhs classifiers. fhs stands for Fast Hyperspace.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.BR PRIMARY_HASH_SEED
.br
.BR SECONDARY_HASH_SEED
.PP
   The hash seeds are used to prime the hashing algorithm. If
   these do not match in both the trainer, when training the
   data, and the classifier when classifying, the results are
   undefined. For this reason, this can be used as a sort of
   pseudo copy protection.
.PP
   Additionally, these values determine, to an extent, the
   number of collisions in hash data. The only way to know if
   you have chosen a good value is testing.
.PP
   Each seed is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 bit number.
   If is \fBnot\fR prefixed with "0x". All alpha characters
   should be uppercase.
.PP
   These \fBmust\fR be the same for all categories.
.PP
.BR FHS_DIRECTORY
.PP
   This is the directory where the fhs files, aka fhs
   classifier data, are stored. All the data here will
   be read in and a preload written out.
.PP
.BR OUTPUT_FHS_PRELOAD_FILE
.PP
   This is the name which the preload file will be given.
   It should not contain any directory compnents as the file
   will be written to the \fBFHS_DIRECTORY\fR.
.PP
WARNING: Spaces and case matter.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
You must always have all the files within each category share the hash seeds.
Additionally, all categories within the same classifier data set \fBmust\fR
share the same hash seeds.
.PP
The use of a preload file dramatically decreases the speed of start-up time for the classifier!
