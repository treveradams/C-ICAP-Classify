fnb_judge \- Fast Naive Bayes command line classifier (judge)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfnb_judge\fP -p \fIPRIMARY_HASH_SEED\fP -s \fISECONDARY_HASH_SEED\fP -i \fIINPUT_FILE_TO_JUDGE\fP -d \fICATEGORY_FNB_FILES_DIR\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfnb_judge\fP is a command-line, stand alone classifier used to test fnb
classifiers. fnb stands for Fast Naive Bayes.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.BR PRIMARY_HASH_SEED
.br
.BR SECONDARY_HASH_SEED
.PP
   The hash seeds are used to prime the hashing algorithm. If
   these do not match in both the trainer, when training the
   data, and the classifier when classifying, the results are
   undefined. For this reason, this can be used as a sort of
   pseudo copy protection.
.PP
   Additionally, these values determine, to an extent, the
   number of collisions in hash data. The only way to know if
   you have chosen a good value is testing.
.PP
   Each seed is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 bit number.
   If is \fBnot\fR prefixed with "0x". All alpha characters
   should be uppercase.
.PP
   These \fBmust\fR be the same for all categories.
.PP
.BR INPUT_FILE_TO_JUDGE
.PP
   This is the file to judge, of course. It must be a UTF-8
   text file, HTML file, or XML file.
.PP
.BR CATEGORY_FNB_FILES_DIR
.PP
   This is the directory where the FNB files, aka FNB
   classifier data, are stored.
.PP
.BR RELATED_STRING
.PP
   This is the directory in which the candidate files are located.
   This is specially formated string made up of substrings.
   The substrigns are joined by "=".
   Each substring has the format of "\fIprimary\fR,\fIsecondary\fR,\fIbidirectional\fR".
.PP
   \fBPrimary\fR is the primary category name.
.PP
   \fBSecondary\fR is the secondary category name.
.PP
   \fBbidirectional\fR determines whether or not the similarity goes both
   directions. Not all should.
.PP
   An example of such a string is:
   "adult.affairs,social.dating,1=adult.*,adult.*,0=clothing.*,clothing.*,0=information.culinary,commerce.food,1"
.PP
   Please, note, this string \fBmust\fR be enclosed in double quotes.
   Also, this option (-r) cannot be provided more than once.
.PP
WARNING: Spaces and case matter.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
You must always have all the files within each category share the hash seeds.
Additionally, all categories within the same classifier data set \fBmust\fR
share the same hash seeds.
