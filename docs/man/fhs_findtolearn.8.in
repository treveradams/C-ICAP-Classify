.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfnd_findtolearn\fP is a command-line tool to find the best file to train next
for a given fhs classifier. fhs stands for Fast Hyperspace.
.PP
This program will return 0 and output the file name (no directory components) of the file which should be trained next, if such exists.
Otherwise, this program returns -1.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.BR PRIMARY_HASH_SEED
.br
.BR SECONDARY_HASH_SEED
.PP
   The hash seeds are used to prime the hashing algorithm. If
   these do not match in both the trainer, when training the
   data, and the classifier when classifying, the results are
   undefined. For this reason, this can be used as a sort of
   pseudo copy protection.
.PP
   Additionally, these values determine, to an extent, the
   number of collisions in hash data. The only way to know if
   you have chosen a good value is testing.
.PP
   Each seed is a hexadecimal representation of a 32 bit number.
   If is \fBnot\fR prefixed with "0x". All alpha characters
   should be uppercase.
.PP
   These \fBmust\fR be the same for all categories.
.PP
.BR INPUT_DIRECTORY_TO_JUDGE
.PP
   This is the directory in which the candidate files are located.
.PP
.BR CATEGORY_FHS_FILES_DIR
.PP
   This is the directory where the fhs files, aka fhs
   classifier data, are stored.
.PP
.BR TARGET_CATEGORY
.PP
   This specifies to which category the input files should belong.
.PP
.BR THRESHHOLD_NOT_TO_EXCEED_TO_REPORT_NEED_TO_TRAIN
.PP
   This tells the program to what extent a candidate file should
   belong to a given category. If a file meets or exceeds this level
   it should not be considered for training.
.PP
.BR NUMBER_OF_THREADS_TO_USE
   This is the number of threads to use when doing training.
   It will only have any useful effect when doing the training
   of a directory; not an individual file.
.PP
.BR RELATED_STRING
.PP
   This is the directory in which the candidate files are located.
   This is specially formated string made up of substrings.
   The substrigns are joined by "=".
   Each substring has the format of "\fIprimary\fR,\fIsecondary\fR,\fIbidirectional\fR".
.PP
   \fBPrimary\fR is the primary category name.
.PP
   \fBSecondary\fR is the secondary category name.
.PP
   \fBbidirectional\fR determines whether or not the similarity goes both
   directions. Not all should.
.PP
   An example of such a string is:
   "adult.affairs,social.dating,1=adult.*,adult.*,0=clothing.*,clothing.*,0=information.culinary,commerce.food,1"
.PP
   Please, note, this string \fBmust\fR be enclosed in double quotes.
   Also, this option (-r) cannot be provided more than once.
.PP
WARNING: Spaces and case matter.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
You must always have all the files within each category share the hash seeds.
Additionally, all categories within the same classifier data set \fBmust\fR
share the same hash seeds.
