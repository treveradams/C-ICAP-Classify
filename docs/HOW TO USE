HOW TO USE?
===========

This is very complex. The following is just a brief overview of how to set it
up. Paths below are relative to the C-ICAP Classify source distribution top
level directory.


What you need:
==============

* C-ICAP - http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/
* Squid Proxy - http://www.squid-cache.org/ (or other ICAP enabled proxy, this
document uses Squid)
* A data set for the classifier (text and/or image data)


How to get it going:
====================

services/classify/c-icap-classify.conf.example contains an example
configuration file.

Most of these options will be set/determined by which data set you use. Some
examples of those that are not necessarily determined by the data set are:
srv_classify.TmpDir /var/tmp/c_icap
srv_classify.TextFileTypes TEXT
srv_classify.ImageFileTypes PNG GIF JPEG BMP ICO
srv_classify.Allow204Responces on
srv_classify.MaxObjectSize 40M
srv_classify.ExternalTextFileType
srv_classify.ExternalImageFileType
srv_classify.MaxMemClassification
srv_classify.MaxTotalMemClassification
srv_classify.MaxWindowSize
srv_classify.ImageMinProcess
srv_classify.debugSaveOriginal 1
srv_classify.debugSaveParts 1
srv_classify.debugSaveMarked 1
srv_classify.debugDemonstrate 1
srv_classify.debugDemonstrateMasked 1
srv_classify.ImageInterpolation LINEAR
srv_classify.ImageMaxScale 4
srv_classify.ImageScaleDimension 240
srv_classify.VideoInterpolation AREA
srv_classify.VideoMaxScale 4
srv_classify.VideoScaleDimension 320
srv_classify.VideoProcessFramesPerSecond 3

and finally, srv_classify.OptimizeFNB, which should be used only after all FNB
data is loaded in your configuration (making it one of the last options in the
configuration file will take care of this).

Please, note that in the above, the spellings are accurate in the
documentation, regardless of the correct spelling of the word.

So, read the documentation that comes with the data set of your choice, use
their options. Some of the above may be sensitive and related to the data set
(particularly the interpolation, scaling, etc.). Follow the documentation on
these and experiment if you believe it is worth changing.

Once you have set all of the appropriate settings and have C-ICAP up and
running, you are ready to configure Squid.


Configuring Squid
=================

Start with a basic, default configuration. This is recommended as the
configuration of Squid in general is beyond the scope of this document. It is
wise to use a caching, basic, secure and simple setup to begin with.

services/classify/HEADERS-FOR-ACL-USE.txt contains information on headers that
can be used in your acl rules. The data set of your choice may have come with
such configuration information.

A few examples of using the headers are as follows, based on an example data
set:

acl adult.pinups rep_header X-TEXT-CATEGORY-NB ^adult.pinups$
acl adult.porn rep_header X-TEXT-CATEGORY-NB ^adult.porn$
acl entertainment.gambling rep_header X-TEXT-CATEGORY-NB ^entertainment.gambling$
acl entertainment.onlinegames rep_header X-TEXT-CATEGORY-NB ^entertainment.onlinegames$

Notice these acls do not deny or grant access to anything. They merely setup
rules that can be checked based on the headers returned by C-ICAP Classify.

deny_info ERR_ACCESS_DENIED_ADULT.PINUPS adult.pinups
deny_info ERR_ACCESS_DENIED_ADULT.PORN adult.porn
deny_info ERR_ACCESS_DENIED_ENTERTAINMENT.GAMBLING entertainment.gambling
deny_info ERR_ACCESS_DENIED_ENTERTAINMENT.ONLINEGAMES entertainment.onlinegames

Again, these rules do NOT deny or grant access. These rules setup what error
page should be shown. These types of rules are used to show specific errors of
desired. Where the files are located and how to configure them is beyond the
scope of this document. The file names, this example, are all in capital
letters.

Now, let us talk about the actual denying/granting of access to certain sites.
Any overrides should be placed before the general rules. An example, might be
for an educational game site used by several school districts in the United
States:

acl AllowedDomains dstdomain .sumdog.com  # Educational Site Encouraged By Some Schools
http_reply_access allow AllowedDomains

Again, the first rule doesn't grant or deny access. It adds the sumdog.com
sites to "AllowedDomains" which is then allowed to everyone.

Some content may be appropriate to some ages and not others (I do not suggest
pornography and the like is one of these, but some use it that way):

auth_param ...

acl authed_users proxy_auth REQUIRED

http_access allow authed_users

external_acl_type NAME OPTIONS

acl ACL_EXCEPTION_TYPE external NAME GROUP

The above five lines setup authentication an one exception called
ACL_EXCEPTION_TYPE. NAME is the name program, options are what is to be fed to
the program. This might be LDAP, SQL or text file look-ups depending on the
helper programs you choose to use. An example of all of this might be:

http_reply_access allow TextConfidenceSolid entertainment.onlinegames adult

This says, allow access to entertainment.onlinegames, if the user is an adult
(ACL_EXCEPTION_TYPE would be replaced with adult in the above section... note
that you can have multiple such exception groups). Notice that
TextConfidenceSolid is similar to the acl rep_headers above. I haven't included
it as it will be based on the C-ICAP Classify configuration (data dependent).

Also note, this http_reply_access allow rule has three conditions that must be
met (AND relationship) TextConfidenceSolid, entertainment.onlinegames, and (our
authentication related group) adult. An OR relationship is done by placing each
on a separate line (one each for each of the conditions). Always use a
TextConfidenceSolid or TextConfidenceAmbiguous, never use a
TextConfidenceNearest. Be very careful of even the Ambiguous. It might be
useful for protecting minors from porn, but it is risky!

Finally, you have your global denies or allows:

http_reply_access deny TextConfidenceSolid adult.pinups
http_reply_access deny TextConfidenceSolid adult.porn
http_reply_access deny TextConfidenceSolid entertainment.gambling
http_reply_access deny TextConfidenceSolid entertainment.onlinegames

In the global section or specific section, you can use deny or allow as needed.
In many of the setups I do, it is best to do specific allows, then global
denies and not do any global allows (unless it is a legally good idea to show
that a protected category, such as religion, is very much intended to be
allowed). If you have very complex rules, you may have specific denies and
global allows for other reasons.

Now, we need to tell squid above the classify icap service, this is done with
the following line (assuming you have no port and address bindings beside the
default in C-ICAP):
icap_service svcClassify respmod_precache bypass=0 routing=0
icap://127.0.0.1:1344/srv_classify

Next, we need to tell it to use the service. This is done with the following
line:
adaptation_service_chain standardChain svcClassify

You can add additional services (such as the C-ICAP ClamAV virus scanning
module) by adding more icap_service lines and adding them to the same
adaptation_service_chain as svcClassify above.

Finally, the acl to say who should use this chain:
adaptation_access standardChain allow all

If you use other modules, such as the virus scanning module, you may need to
remove the all on the above adaptation_access and make it more restrictive. You
would then need alternative chain/chains with the appropriate options to bypass
them. An example of this is if you use the virelator mode in the virus scanning
module. Without providing a chain that bypasses it and the appropriate access
rules, security and program update sites (Windows Updates, etc.) will be
broken. Please, refer to the appropriate documentation to discover the
appropriate options and how to use them to implement this alternative chain.

If you use transparent proxying, authentication does NOT work. All denied page
types will be denied for everyone. In one setup known to the documenter, both
transparent and normal proxying are used. When the browser is pointed to the
appropriate proxy server (This would be the fully qualified domain name, i.e.
proxy.example.org, and port 3128 for standard Squid setup) it will then
authenticate properly. This means that only the browsers setup to directly use
the proxy authenticate, the others don't. This is necessary due to the
configuration of phones, tablets, etc. and the lack of authentication mechanism
on such devices as decided would be the only method for security reasons.

One final note: if you deny something and a later line allows it, it will be
denied. Allows must happen first, hence one reason why I do allows as specifics
and do global denies after!


Great, where can I get a data set?
==================================

At this time, I do not know of a publicly available data set, whether free as
in gratis or free as in liberty or cost. I know of at least two that are in
development. One is nearly ready for prime time other than legal issues
(licensing, intended to be gratis to home uses, businesses, schools, etc.,
anyone who doesn't make money off of it; i.e. may not be free to consultants,
contractors, ISPs, etc.) in English with partial support for many others. (The
accompanying image data set is not as far along due to changes in the OpenCV
library training algorithm and resultant problems which haven't been fixed as
of yet; it otherwise would be ready for testing.)

If you are a lawyer and interested in helping to bring this to light and have
some time and the skills to go with it and wish to donate such services, please
contact the main developer for details. The other data set, its existence is
known, but not the status.

Sorry.


What about SSL/TLS (secure websites)... why aren't they classified?
===================================================================

Simple answer: Because they are encrypted and the content is unavailable.

COMPLEX! DANGEROUS! PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! answer:
sslBump functionality in Squid can overcome this. I mention this only so
advanced, informed, technical people can be aware there is a solution. It is
complex and the security risks are very high if even the slightest mistakes are
made. Also, not all services/programs/certificates will allow this setup to
work, so it is important to have someone who can recognize how/when to use this
and how to bypass it for specific clients/services/sites.


Alright. I have it up and running. Is that enough?
==================================================

Unfortunately, no. It is impossible to block/filter everything. Appropriate
firewall rules, sslBump, etc. can help. I will not document those things here
as a competent individual will know how to handle and mitigate most of the ways
around this content classifier and the general public doesn't need
documentation on how to bypass it.

Additionally, if you care about people, or live in an area where you may be
liable for the addictive behavior of employees/members (yes, there have been
some rather screwy court decisions over the last decade), then you may also
wish to do a few more things. Please, consult with appropriate legal or other
professionals, but here is a short list:

1) Acceptable use policies are a must.
2) Instead of just saying a website is blocked, it may be wise to encourage
addiction recovery/support programs (21 steps made famous by AA or any other
such things). This is especially true of things that have been documented to
destroy lives in one way or another, such as, addiction to pornography and the
like, addiction to gambling and addiction to playing games (not gambling).
3) Possibly including warnings about addictive/inappropriate behavior that
includes information on such recovery/support programs.

Finally, "Well-taught doctrines and principles have a more powerful influence
on behavior than rules." (Dallin H. Oaks, 1999) Whether you are a business, a
non-profit, private organization, church, or family, this statement will help
with all appropriate/inappropriate behavior more than most any other thing.
Education. Information. Enlightenment. The way you implement it will vary
depending on what kind of organization is in question and what the culture
and/or values of that organization is. This is one reason this classifier was
designed to be very flexible.
