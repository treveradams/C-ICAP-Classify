The following are HTTP headers added by C-ICAP Classify. Any of these
may be used, if supported by your proxy, to setup your filter.

TEXT HEADERS FOR ACL USE
===================
X-TEXT-ERROR:
This will appear if there was some error in processing the text.

X-TEXT-CATEGORY-(HS|NB):
This is the configured category name for which there is the best match
to the document in question.

X-TEXT-CATEGORY-LEVEL-(HS|NB):
Most likely this header is useless as it is a probability scaled using
a base 2 log. Squid, for one, won't allow numerical comparison.

X-TEXT-CATEGORY-CONFIDENCE-(HS|NB):
This will be "SOLID" for a solid match. "AMBIGUOUS" for a possible, but
uncertain match. "NEAREST" for the closest category.

X-TEXT-SECONDARY-CATEGORY-(HS|NB)
X-TEXT-SECONDARY-CATEGORY-LEVEL-(HS|NB)
X-TEXT-SECONDARY-CATEGORY-CONFIDENCE-(HS|NB):
These are the same as those without SECONDARY but only show up when you
have configured a primary/secondary relationship.



IMAGE HEADERS FOR ACL USE
=========================
X-IMAGE-ERROR:
If there was some kind of error in processing the image, you will see
this header.

X-IMAGE-CATEGORIES:
This will only show up if objects are detected in the image. The values
for this are the name of the category/categories detected followed by a
number sign for each of those objects detected up to 10 inside of
parentheses. Over 10 will also have a +. Example: Breasts(###) Butts(#)
for 3 breasts and 1 butt.

X-REFERRER-TEXT-CATEGORY-CONFIDENCE-(HS|NB)
X-REFERRER-TEXT-CATEGORY-(HS|NB)
X-REFERRER-TEXT-SECONDARY-CATEGORY-CONFIDENCE-(HS|NB)
X-REFERRER-TEXT-SECONDARY-CATEGORY-(HS|NB):
All of these will show up only if X-IMAGE-CATEGORIES is present. They
have the content that the referrer had in X-TEXT-* by the same names.
These headers are useful if images should be blocked in some cases, but
not others. Example might be some medical nudity being allowed, but
nudity normally being blocked.
==WARNING==
The X-REFERRER-* headers are only available IF the request for the
image in question goes through the same C-ICAP server as the referring
page and within a short enough time it remains in the referrer cache,
which currently is limited to 1000 web page requests. (Image and video
files are not counted in this number.)
